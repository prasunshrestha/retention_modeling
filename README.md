# Project Overview

A movement to end educational inequity and attain quality education for all children, TFA loses hundreds of corps members during the school year who, unfortunately, do not complete their fellowship. A predictive model will serve as a preventive measure to assess and reduce early program exits as the coaches could intervene before the fellow drops out. I worked on the project to build machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression) that predicted the corps membersâ€™ early program exit probability to strategize early intervention.
