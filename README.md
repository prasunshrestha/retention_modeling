A space for Steve and Prasun to share code for retention modeling. The variable we are predicting is "SwellOneExit."

A movement to end educational inequity and attain quality education for all children, TFA loses hundreds of corps members during the school year who, unfortunately, do not complete their fellowship. A predictive model will serve as a preventive measure to assess and reduce early program exits as the coaches could intervene before the fellow drops out. Thus, I strive to work in a cross-functional team and translate loose business problems and disparate data into actionable insights and business recommendations through rigorous analysis, insightful visualizations, and engaging presentations.
